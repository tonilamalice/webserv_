    <h1>About Our Web Server Project</h1>

    <p>This web server project is a collaborative effort by three associates: Romain, Antoine D., and Antoine V. Together, we have developed a server as part of the 42 project.</p>

    <p>The 42 project is a server written from scratch in C++. It represents a significant undertaking, involving the creation of a web server capable of handling HTTP requests and serving web pages. Writing a server from scratch allows us to gain a deep understanding of the intricacies of web technologies and networking.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to create a robust and efficient web server that showcases our skills and knowledge in software development. We are excited about the challenges this project presents and look forward to contributing to the world of web development.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
